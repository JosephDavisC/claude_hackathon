## 🏆 Hackathon Journey

### Inspiration

As transfer students ourselves, we experienced firsthand the frustration of navigating UW's transfer equivalency process. We built this tool to streamline that experience for future transfers.

### Key Challenges

- **Transcript Formatting Variations** - Different colleges format transcripts differently; required extensive prompt engineering
- **Accurate Matching** - Balancing prediction confidence with practical utility
- **Privacy & Security** - Implementing proper consent and secure handling of student documents
- **Time Constraints** - Building a production-ready app in a hackathon timeframe

### Accomplishments

- ✅ Created a functional tool that reduces research time from hours to seconds
- ✅ Implemented real equivalency data from official UW sources
- ✅ Built comprehensive features: parsing, matching, reports, and email generation
- ✅ Designed intuitive UX that requires no technical knowledge
- ✅ **Won the Anthropic Claude Hackathon!**

### What We Learned

- Advanced prompt engineering techniques for structured outputs
- Claude Vision API capabilities for document processing
- Importance of user consent and privacy in AI applications
- Practical challenges in building AI tools for education
