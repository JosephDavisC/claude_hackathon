## How to Use

1. **Enter your information** - Name and intended major at UW
2. **Upload your transcript** - Drag & drop a PDF/image, or paste plain text
3. **Click "Evaluate Transfer Credits"** - Watch the AI process your courses in real-time
4. **Review your results** - See detailed transfer report with color-coded matches:
   - **Green** - Direct equivalency match
   - **Blue** - Semantic match (similar course content)
   - **Yellow** - Elective credit (counts toward degree, no direct equivalent)
   - **Red** - Requires advisor review
5. **Download PDF report** - Get a professional document for advising appointments
6. **Generate advisor email** - AI-crafted email template for unmatched courses

### Sample Transcript Format

```
MATH& 151 - Calculus I - 5 credits - Grade: A
ENGL& 101 - English Composition - 5 credits - Grade: B+
CS& 141 - Computer Science I - 4 credits - Grade: A
CHEM& 161 - General Chemistry I - 5 credits - Grade: A-

## Technical Architecture

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **AI/ML:** Anthropic Claude API (Sonnet 4.5 with Vision)
- **PDF Processing:** jsPDF, pdf-parse
- **Backend:** Next.js API Routes, Node.js

```

### How It Works

1. **Transcript Processing**
   - User uploads PDF/image or pastes text
   - Claude Vision API extracts course information
   - Structured output ensures consistent parsing

2. **Course Matching**
   - Exact matches checked against 157+ verified equivalencies
   - Semantic matching uses Claude to compare course descriptions
   - Applies UW's 90-credit transfer cap automatically

3. **Report Generation**
   - AI summarizes findings in student-friendly language
   - jsPDF creates downloadable professional reports
   - Claude generates personalized advisor request emails

## Hackathon Journey

### Inspiration

As transfer students ourselves, we experienced firsthand the frustration of navigating UW's transfer equivalency process. We built this tool to streamline that experience for future transfers.

### Key Challenges

- **Transcript Formatting Variations** - Different colleges format transcripts differently; required extensive prompt engineering
- **Accurate Matching** - Balancing prediction confidence with practical utility
- **Privacy & Security** - Implementing proper consent and secure handling of student documents
- **Time Constraints** - Building a production-ready app in a hackathon timeframe

### Accomplishments

- Created a functional tool that reduces research time from hours to seconds
- Implemented real equivalency data from official UW sources
- Built comprehensive features: parsing, matching, reports, and email generation
- Designed intuitive UX that requires no technical knowledge
- **Won the Anthropic Claude Hackathon!**

### What We Learned

- Advanced prompt engineering techniques for structured outputs
- Claude Vision API capabilities for document processing
- Importance of user consent and privacy in AI applications
- Practical challenges in building AI tools for education
